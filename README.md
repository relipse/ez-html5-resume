# ez-html5-resume
An HTML5 Resume, just enter your info in the config.inc.php file and off you go! ( See http://sharpmailer.us/jimkinsman )

Basically all you need to do is create a file called config.inc.php and populate it. (see config-default.inc.php for my example)
That's it. All your info should be ready to go as your own Resume.
Have fun,
Let me know what you think.
